# go-pglock Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating various use cases for `go-pglock`.

## Prerequisites

1. PostgreSQL running and accessible
2. Database created (default: `pglock`)
3. Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (optional)

```bash
# Using docker-compose from the project root
docker-compose up -d

# Or set custom database URL
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable'
```

## Running Examples

### Basic Lock Usage

Demonstrates the fundamental lock acquire and release pattern.

```bash
cd examples/basic
go run main.go
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Creating a lock
- Acquiring a lock with `Lock()` (non-blocking)
- Performing work in a critical section
- Releasing the lock

**Try it:**
Run two instances in different terminals to see one acquire the lock while the other is blocked.

### Concurrent Workers

Shows how multiple workers coordinate access to a shared resource.

```bash
cd examples/workers
go run main.go
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Multiple goroutines competing for the same lock
- `WaitAndLock()` blocking behavior
- Sequential execution enforced by the lock
- Proper cleanup in concurrent scenarios

**Expected output:**
- Workers start and wait for the lock
- Workers execute one at a time (serialized)
- Each worker holds the lock for ~1 second

### Leader Election

Implements a simple leader election mechanism.

```bash
cd examples/leader-election
go run main.go
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Leader election pattern
- Only one instance becomes the leader
- Leader performing periodic tasks
- Followers waiting/skipping work

**Use cases:**
- Distributed systems where only one instance should perform certain tasks
- Active-passive failover scenarios
- Coordinating cluster-wide operations

### Timeout Handling

Shows how to use context timeouts with lock operations.

```bash
cd examples/timeout
go run main.go
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Creating locks with timeout contexts
- Handling `context.DeadlineExceeded` errors
- Different timeout values and their effects
- Proper cleanup when timeouts occur

**Expected output:**
- First attempt fails due to short timeout
- Second attempt succeeds with longer timeout

### Task Processing

Demonstrates distributed task processing with lock-based coordination.

```bash
cd examples/task-processing
go run main.go
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Using task IDs to generate lock IDs
- Preventing duplicate task execution
- Hash-based lock ID generation
- Handling already-processing scenarios

**Use cases:**
- Job queues in distributed systems
- Idempotent task processing
- Preventing race conditions in task execution

## Running Multiple Instances

To see the distributed locking in action, run the same example in multiple terminal windows:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd examples/basic
go run main.go

# Terminal 2 (run simultaneously)
cd examples/basic
go run main.go
```

You'll see that only one instance acquires the lock while others wait or skip.

## Customizing Examples

All examples use the same database connection pattern:

```go
dsn := os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")
if dsn == "" {
    dsn = "postgres://test:test@localhost:5432/pglock?sslmode=disable"
}
```

You can customize the connection by:
1. Setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. Modifying the default DSN in the code
3. Using connection parameters in the DSN string

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Try Lock (Non-blocking)

Use when you want to skip work if another instance is already doing it:

```go
acquired, err := lock.Lock(ctx)
if !acquired {
    return // Skip work
}
// Do work
```

### Pattern 2: Wait for Lock (Blocking)

Use when work must be done eventually:

```go
if err := lock.WaitAndLock(ctx); err != nil {
    return err
}
// Do work
```

### Pattern 3: Lock with Timeout

Use when you want to wait but not indefinitely:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
defer cancel()

if err := lock.WaitAndLock(ctx); err != nil {
    // Handle timeout or other errors
}
// Do work
```

## Building Examples

To build all examples:

```bash
# From the examples directory
for dir in */; do
    echo "Building ${dir%/}..."
    (cd "$dir" && go build -o "../../bin/${dir%/}" .)
done
```

This creates binaries in the `bin/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

### "DATABASE_URL environment variable not set"

Either set the environment variable or use the default connection string in the code.

### "pq: database does not exist"

Create the database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pglock;
```

### "connection refused"

Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Lock Never Released

Check that:
- `defer lock.Close()` is present
- Program doesn't panic before cleanup
- Context isn't cancelled prematurely
